#include<iostream> 


//this is my 9th leetcode PROBLEM 

//MY FIRST APPROACH I HAVE in steps are;

/*
1. Sort the strings in the VECTOR 

2. STORE IT IN A DATA STRUCTURE, I WILL USE UNORDERED MAP

3. ITERATE OVER IT, FIND THE SAME STRINGS 

4. STORE THEM AGAIN, RETURN THE VECTOR 

5. PUSH IT TO THE GLOBAL VECTOR

    std::cout << "hello world";
    return 0;
